### Changelog/Notes
Below is a reverse-chronological log of changes to this policy.

Per [the January 2022 newsletter](https://github.com/electorama/abif/discussions/28), here's the licenses you need to agree to in order to do much of anything with the bits found in this repository:

* The [Apache License 2.0](https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0.html) for software.
* The [Creative Commons BY-SA 4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/) for the specification.

One thing I'll add: we also need to consider the [IETF's RFC 8179](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8179).  Do not try to interject stealth patents into this specification.

Please agree to the license for this repository before contributing:

We need to solve a few things before accepting serious contributions:

* Copyright: what license will the reference implementation be under?  Probably MIT, but there's at least a couple of scenarios where [@robla](https://github.com/robla) could imagine Apache of even AGPL to be more appropriate.
* Copyright assignment: do we need this?
* Patent policy: do we need to make sure we aren't subject to stealth patenting of our work here?
